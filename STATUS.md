# Bade Applications for This Project

## Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable

As part of our project, we have provided and documented our code in great detail so our stakeholders can continue to use and evaluate their future datasets. This code in this repository produced all of the visuals and analysis of our paper. It contains a complete guide on how the dataset was analyzed and all relevant steps in the process.

The original dataset is proprietary so we have provided a randomized dataset as an example of how the code operates.

This project contains working examples of:
* Completing hyper parameter tuning for a sequence based dataset
* Creating finalized models
* Analyzing these models using multiple XAI tools

These artifacts are a relevant example to anyone who may apply these XAI tools to future project and need to compare results of various XAI tools. This repository contains a description of how to setup and install a set of compatible libraries and how to compare the results of multiple XAI tools on the same dataset and models.

## Artifacts Available

This project is hosted on a github repository and is marked as a release. There is a DOI link provided using Zenodo with a doi `10.5281/zenodo.4818970` and can be found at the link [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4818970](10.5281/zenodo.4818970) with all the related artifacts and files in this github repository.

These artifacts will remain permanently available for retrieval at this doi even if the github repository is not available.
